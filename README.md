## About

### Summary
This repo houses the code, board files, CAD files and documents for the SCuM observatory.

The SCuM observatory is designed as a portable platform that accommodates a SCuM breakout board alongside various measurement devices. These devices provide direct access to the SCuMâ€™s I/O, enabling power control and monitoring, digital and analog pin stimulation/measurement, RF stimulation/measurement, and programming. All communication with the observatory, including control of its measurement devices, occurs through a single USB cable. A Python scripting interface is used for high-level interactions with the observatory and its hardware.
